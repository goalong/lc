#
# Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth
# largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
# 
# For example,
# Given [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2, return 5.
# 
# 
# Note: 
# You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.
# 
# Credits:Special thanks to @mithmatt for adding this problem and creating all
# test cases.
